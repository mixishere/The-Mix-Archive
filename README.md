# The Mix Archive
This is all my things, from clicker games to a collection of other games. 

# DON'T STEAL

# Key
Disk: Compact game launcher, Basically Dread but just the games.
Clickr: a clicker game that loads on to your screen
Dread: A darkened version of Car Axle client. If you want the original, go to penguilify's page.
Paintbrush: A gui that changes color of the website you use it it on. (kinda useless)
Aurora: a tool to rule the archive.
Sunset: watered down aurora but way mor pleasent to look at
stuff not on here is probably just aurora shenanigans and expirimental stuff.
